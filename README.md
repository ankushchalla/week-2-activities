# HW: 01 HTML CSS Git - Code Refactor

## Installation
* Main html file: `index.html`
* CSS file: `assets/css/style.css`
* Images: `assets/images`

**Note:** `index.html` links to the stylesheet and images through the paths listed above. 
If you change the paths of the above files on your machine, be sure to change the paths in `index.html` accordingly. 

## Usage
Open `index.html` in Google Chrome. **Note:** This page does not follow principles of responsive design, 
and will only render properly on a laptop or desktop moniter.

## Credits
The starter code used for the refactor is on [Github](https://ucriverside.bootcampcontent.com/UC-Riverside-Coding-Boot-Camp/ucr-riv-fsf-pt-10-2020-u-c/-/tree/master/01-HTML-Git-CSS/02-Homework/Develop).
